 Assignment 7.4: Interactive 3D Environment

 At this point in the course, you should have a good understanding of all elements that come together to create a visually appealing interactive user experience. Use what you have learned about interaction, materials, UIs, and animation in Unity to create your own interactive 3D environment.

At a minimum, your assignment should include the following:

A set of assets arranged in a cohesive way which makes sense for your environment—you can browse the asset store for asset packs, create them yourself, or collaborate with someone from your workplace to create them together
A first-person camera that responds to mouse motion, along with WASD movement, so that users can navigate through and look around in the environment you have created
A set of boundaries that prevent the user from going outside of the bounds of your environment
A set of other entities that respond to the user's presence or input via animation—your environment should feel “alive” in some way and should respond to the user
The environment should include a functioning UI
Tertiary cosmetic elements like sounds and lights
